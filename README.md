## Project Overview
The project applies a data-driven approach to smart energy supply scheduling, leveraging historical energy data to predict future usage and create cost-efficient energy strategies for sustainable telecom networks.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project involves addressing the challenge of optimizing energy usage across telecom sites powered by multiple sources: grid, diesel, and solar energy. The task requires developing a machine-learning model capable of predicting the optimal energy source at each time step while minimizing overall costs. Additionally, the solution must maintain battery capacity above a set threshold to ensure continuous operation. The problem is complex due to the fluctuating availability of renewable energy and varying energy costs, requiring a robust strategy for cost-effective energy allocation.
