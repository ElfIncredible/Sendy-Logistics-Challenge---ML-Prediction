## Project Overview
The project applies a data-driven approach to smart energy supply scheduling, leveraging historical energy data to predict future usage and create cost-efficient energy strategies for sustainable telecom networks.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project involves addressing the challenge of optimizing energy usage across telecom sites powered by multiple sources: grid, diesel, and solar energy. The task requires developing a machine-learning model capable of predicting the optimal energy source at each time step while minimizing overall costs. Additionally, the solution must maintain battery capacity above a set threshold to ensure continuous operation. The problem is complex due to the fluctuating availability of renewable energy and varying energy costs, requiring a robust strategy for cost-effective energy allocation.

## Dataset
The [dataset](https://zindi.africa/competitions/sendy-logistics-challenge/data) used in the project includes energy usage data across multiple telecom sites, each powered by grid, diesel, and solar energy sources. It contains variables such as energy output (kWh), solar zenith angle, relative humidity, battery charge and discharge coefficients, and grid outage plans. Additionally, site-specific attributes like battery capacity, rated voltage, and diesel power output are included. The dataset spans various time periods, making it well-suited for predicting energy consumption patterns and optimizing the energy mix for minimizing operational costs while maintaining battery health.
